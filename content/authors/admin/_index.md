Student and educator. My academic concerns lie in the intersection between mathematics, physics and philosophy. Some particular things I am actively interested in (yet have little knowledge): logic, epistemology, philosophy of science, classical field theory, differential geometry. I am also a follower of Chinese politics and civil rights movements.
